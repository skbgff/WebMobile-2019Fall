This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.5.

To begin you will need node.js, npm and mondo db installed as noted in the web_lesson_7 read me.
Once installed you use "npm install" to install all node packages
Server and Front-end can both be run from the command line by using "npm run start"

Basic user authenticaion is initially handled using Passport JWT exchange.
Look at header for basic routing and guidance options.
To create a user use the register" link on the landing page.  
Once this has been done additional profile edit features are available in the edit user workflow.

To asscess "admin" functions and links from the landing page edit profile and set the user name to "Admin".
Once you log out and log back in new links should be availbe.  You can use these links to create classes
which a normal user can then enroll in. 

Outstanding featuers to create:
 - scheduled/calendar look up
 - ajax search of unenrolled classes
 - image for user
 - book search
